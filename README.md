The game GAA Air Hockey which I am developing but was designed by Andreas Fahey another student is an air hockey-like game but themed around GAA which is the Gaelic Athletic Association.

## How to run
#### Android
The game was developed for the Android platform, please find the APK here:

###  [Releases](https://github.com/butlawr/gaa-air-hockey/releases/tag/1.0)

### Linux
Source code is available from cloning this project and opening it in Unity. You may also download and import the package to Unity inside a new 2D project.<br>
   * NOTE: The application was developed as an Android build within Unity on Linux, please take this into account when using it on Windows.<br>
        - On Linux package imports and works as it should.
        - On Windows the importing package method does not seem to work correctly, I beieve.
   * Once the project is opened or the package has been imported into a project make sure to set the Game screen view to `Portrait` as the game was developed to be played only in this view.
