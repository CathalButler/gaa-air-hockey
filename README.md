# Final Year Mobile Application Development Project
## Introduction
The game GAA Air Hockey which I am developing but was designed by Andreas Fahey another student is an air hockey-like game but themed around GAA which is the Gaelic Athletic Association.
### [Game Design Doc](https://github.com/butlawr/gaa-air-hockey/blob/master/uploads/MobileAppsDesignDocument.pdf)

[GAA](https://www.gaa.ie/)
> The Gaelic Athletic Association is an Irish international amateur sporting and cultural organisation, focused primarily on promoting indigenous Gaelic games and pastimes, which include the traditional Irish sports of hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, Gaelic handball and rounders

## Game Requirements
After being issued the game design document from the designer we were required by the lecture to have the following

* Menu System – Splash Screen, Introduction, Preferences, Scores, Tutorials
* Scoring System – A score/rewards system with different score values for different enemies,
items or tasks that the player must deal with
* Multiple Levels – Player competence and confidence in the game must be challenged with
new levels of increasing difficulty. These should have been documented in the design phase.
* Multiple types of obstacle/enemy. There are different levels, so each must accommodate
different threats.
* Sound System – Appropriate sounds and music must be incorporated. You do not need to
compose the music. You can import a piece, but it should work with the game and needs to
be referenced.

in the game and if something was missing we must meet with the design of the game to come up with a solution to implement it.
